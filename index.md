<p style='text-align: justify;'> The key is to know how to shift the odds toward achieving the most optimal health, given the genes that you were born with, by making your internal environment—your cellular environment—as favorable as possible. Your health and vitality are in your hands. You don’t have to be a doctor or be able to diagnose yourself to start making changes in your own body at the cellular level. No matter what details we tease out of the picture as we try to diagnose and distinguish one disease from another, the truth is that dysfunction starts at the mitochondrial and cellular levels with broken biochemistry. If we arrest it there, the body can heal. </p>
